yoko-tools (1.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Remove "arg" useless parameter since it would provoke the following error:
             TypeError: integration_wait_subcommand() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

  * Support a configuration file containing the device model along with the device node.

    A configuration file spares users the need to specify these information within the
    command-line. However, when they do so, these information prevail over the corresponding
    data from the configuration file.

  * Support "-m | --devmodel" command-line argument.

    With "-m | --devmodel", users can specify which power meter device model they want to use.

  * Check integration timer is > 0 when mode is "continuous"

    Starting integration with a timer value of "0" and a mode set to "continuous" is not possible
    anymore. Instead, users are instructed about what to do as per below message:
    "yokotool: ERROR: Please, set a timer value higher than "0" to start integration in "continuous" mode."

  * Improve Error messages readability in PowerMeter.py library.

    Before we would get a message like:
      $ ./yokotool /dev/usbtmc0 read V -l 2
      yokotool: ERROR: failed to write command "
      *CLS" to <yokotools.transport.USBTMC object at 0x7f809de34190>: error while writing to device '/dev/usbtmc0': [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

    Now we get:
      $ ./yokotool /dev/usbtmc0 read V -l 2
      yokotool: ERROR: failed to write command "*CLS" to the power meter:
      error while writing to device '/dev/usbtmc0': [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

  * Improve the organization of integration related commands.

    New syntax to:
      Trigger an integration command:
      $ yokotool <device_node> integration <wait | start | stop | reset>

      Get the value of an integration property:
      $ yokotool <device_node> integration <state | mode | timer>

      Set the value of an integration property:
      $ yokotool <device_node> integration <mode | timer> <value>

  * Improve the organization of smoothing related commands.

    New syntax to:
      Get the value of a smoothing property:
      $ yokotool <device_node> smoothing <status | type | factor>

      Set the value of a smoothing property:
      $ yokotool <device_node> smoothing <status | type | factor> <value>

yoko-tools (1.0) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Show the right help message for integration subcommands that would always show "wait"
    subcommand help message.

  * Support "--version" as a standalone option which makes it work in the same model as "-h/--help".

  * Document yokotool's man page, and rework the help for something very minimalistic since examples
    and long descriptions are now in the man page.

  * Reword some help messages to keep the style consistent.

  * Enable support of "?" option for "read", "set" and "set <subcommand>", "get", "integration" and
    "smoothing" commands. Users can get further information about the arguments expected by some
    commands.

  * Add a README file containing generic information as well as our coding style guidelines.

  * Change "read <limit>" positional argument to "read -l/--limit" optional argument.

yoko-tools (0.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When setting interval, a misleading error message is outputted to user when they enter
    a whole number (i.e. 5) instead of a rational number (i.e. 5.0).

  * Bug fix: Do not display duplicated error messages.

  * Change Voltage notation from U to V since V is the letter most commonly used in physics
    litterature and documentation.

  * Implement socket-based interface: yokotool listens on a TCP port defined by user, processes
    commands directed there, and routes results to that same TCP port.
