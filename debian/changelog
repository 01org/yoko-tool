yoko-tools (1.0) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Show the right help message for integration subcommands that would always show "wait"
    subcommand help message.

  * Support "--version" as a standalone option which makes it work in the same model as "-h/--help".

  * Document yokotool's man page, and rework the help for something very minimalistic since examples
    and long descriptions are now in the man page.

  * Reword some help messages to keep the style consistent.

  * Enable support of "?" option for "read", "set" and "set <subcommand>", "get", "integration" and
    "smoothing" commands. Users can get further information about the arguments expected by some
    commands.

  * Add a README file containing generic information as well as our coding style guidelines.

  * Change "read <limit>" positional argument to "read -l/--limit" optional argument.

yoko-tools (0.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When setting interval, a misleading error message is outputted to user when they enter
    a whole number (i.e. 5) instead of a rational number (i.e. 5.0).

  * Bug fix: Do not display duplicated error messages.

  * Change Voltage notation from U to V since V is the letter most commonly used in physics
    litterature and documentation.

  * Implement socket-based interface: yokotool listens on a TCP port defined by user, processes
    commands directed there, and routes results to that same TCP port.
