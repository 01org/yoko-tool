Productization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Bug fix
- None.

2. New features
- None.

3. Other improvements
- Support a "~/.yokotool.conf" file that stores the device node along with other info (i.e. default
  format for outputted data, default data separator, etc).

- Review/improve commands:
  * Remove "current-auto-range" sub-command, just use "current-range auto" instead. Same for the
    "get" and "voltage" parts.

- Teach the tool to output data as CSV format using for instance "-f/--format" option. Default
  separator could be ";".

- Review the command-line interface, change it if necessary. And it is recommended to get a fresh
  look on it, as well as feedback about the commands (do they make sense? is naming meaningful? etc).

- Read Yokogawa's manual, and improve the help messages:
  * Explain integration better in help output.
  * Explain math stuff better in help output.
  * Explain averaging stuff better in help output.
  * Add longer description for subcommands.
  Help should be straight to the point and practical (i.e. 2 or 3 sentences for explanations + usage
  examples). It could make sense to refer to Yokogawa's manual for further detail for instance (we
  should not rewrite the contents of the manual!!).

- Refactor the source code (consider using named tuples for data structures of more than 3 items
  maybe, etc).

- Clean up the source code (remove useless back slashes for split messages, fix typos, make messages
  formatting consistent, etc).

- Add some testing:
  * Maybe python nose tests
  * Investigate the usefulness of using bart - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bart-py/1.1.0
  * When tests are set up, measure the coverage http://coverage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

- Add a generic ESC filter to the logger to filter out all the ESC-sequences: ESC-sequences are a
  way to instruct a terminal to do something special, like change the color, they are not meant for
  displaying "as-is". Terminals interpret ESC-sequences, but this does not happen when the output is
  a file.

- Factorize some repeating patterns (like "ValueError" exception) into a separate "helpers.py" file.
  For instance, a "is_int()" helper which returns a boolean value could be introduced for
  "ValueError" exception.

- Add a script to assist maintainer in releasing the project (refer to "bmap-tool" project
  http://git.infradead.org/users/dedekind/bmap-tools.git).

- Port Yoko tool to Python 3.

- Investigate the usefulness of packaging Yoko tool for distribution at PyPI -
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi


Long-term improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Depending on user feedback, add features, improve code. The biggest request
   so far was to add WT210 support.
